## Components In Use and Features


- Built in Localization (Internationalization)
We are using `react-intl` a Yahoo component library, this library follows a strict format for what
'text' should look like. However it comes with amazinly supported utilities for cross browser translation.
There is a helper fn `createIntlMessage` within utils that helps create the probs object needed for
`FormattedMessage`

- Styled Components
We are using `emotion` for styled components. This is a modern way of styling in react. 

- Gatsby Images
We are using `gatsby-image` and `gastby-transformer-sharp` for image processing
