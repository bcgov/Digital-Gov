## Things to do for this Repository

### Functional Testing

- Ensure that the base url found at `functional-tests/src/test/resources/GebConfig.groovy`
  is the one you are expecting for dev mode, in addition there are some commented out paths to 
  deployed versions of the app, ensure those paths are the correct ones!

- Clean up all unused npm packages especially gatsby related ones
